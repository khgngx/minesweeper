# MinesweeperProject

A simple Java Swing Minesweeper game.

## Structure

- `src/Main.java` - Entry point, starts the game.
- `src/Minesweeper.java` - Main GUI window and grid initialization.
- `src/MSButton.java` - Custom JButton for each cell in the grid.
- `src/GameLogic.java` - Placeholder for game logic (mines, neighbor counts).

## Running

Compile and run from the `src` directory, for example:

```bash
javac *.java
java Main
```

When `Main` is executed, a window with a 9x9 grid of buttons will appear.
